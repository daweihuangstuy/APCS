Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
Watching this first episode of the COSMOS series really changed my perception of space and
it made me feel insignificant when I compare myself to the vast expanse of space and time.
I think Neil Degrasse Tyson did a really good job as the host of this series because he presented
information very clearly and logically. I also really like the fact that this series covered the
lives in addition to the works done by these scientists as these things generally get overlooked
in all the other science documentaries I had watched. To me the lives of these scientists bring as
much fascination as the work they have done because from the perspective of their life you can see
much of their motivations for discovery. The graphics in this series is AMAZING to say the least and
I have never in my life seen so much attention to detail in the animations portraying the celestial
bodies. One critique that I have of this series, however, is that although the information presented
in the series is articulate, I did not feel like it presented any novel ideas that would lead me to an
epiphany about space. 10/10 on the detail in graphics, but I feel like it is severely lacking detail in
facts and I was presented with a very generic picture of space time. This is the first episode of this
series so I am hopeful that it is only an introduction to the more detailed episodes I will watch later on.

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
This episode was really amazing and it definitely contained the details I was looking for after I watched the
first episode. I especially liked the scientists in this episode and how they were portrayed by the animation
and commentary by Neil Degrasse Tyson. I found the collaboration between Halley and Newton to be as captivating
as the rivalry between Hooke and Newton. Although this episode did portray the serious degree of animosity that
had exisited between Newton and Hooke, I believed that it did dump a lot more dirt on Hooke than it did on
Newton. Despite the fact that no portrait of Hooke existed, the animation choose to portray Hooke as a mean
spirited old man while Newton was shown to be a rather charming individual. I also liked the fact that despite
the main focus of this series is on astronomy, it found time to explore the other contributions these scientists
made to society. The episode mentioned, for example, that Halley perfected the diving bell, laided the foundation
for population statistics, and introduced symbols that were still used on weather maps. For Newton, they had
mentioned that he had experimented with Alchemy and was a fanatic that tried to find hidden meaning in biblical
text. I had not known these facts prior to watching this episode and it really did come as a surprise to me
that Newton had experimented with what is now regarded as a psuedoscience. The movie also did very briefly
mention that Newton was reponsible for the invention of calculus and I am very disappointed that they did not 
emphasize this achievement to as large of an extent as his discoveries with light for example. This episode 
reaffirmed my generic understanding of comets and the cosmos at large but I was introduced to a variety of 
detailed information that I had not known prior to watching this episode.

Episode 7 - "The Clean Room"
@-------------------------------------------------
After I was finished watching this episode, I felt like this series had taken a turn away from talking of
exploration and decided to focus on lead and the age of our Earth. It was fascinating to see how people from
the time of an Irish archbishop during the middle ages to a scientist of the modern age were interested in
using whatever means and methods avaliable to them in order to determine the age of our Earth and of our 
universe. While the archbishop calculated the age of the world on a purely biblical and historical basis, it 
was fascinating to see how someone like Patterson can come to a conclusion by measuring the concentration of
lead from within a certain mineral dated back to the beginnings of Earth's existance. This shows documented
the difficulties that Patterson faced because he was unable to purify his environment of lead contamination
and keep it from interfering with the result of his experimentation. The high prevelance of lead in the 
environment at that time, as he would later find out, is a byproduct of the heavy use of lead in the
environment and especially with leaded gasoline. Although people had known from the time of the Romans that
lead was a poisonous substance when consumed by humans, people still used it regardless for the sake of 
convenience and profit. Patterson, for example, had to defend himself vigorously against another scientist
who was backed by a oil company who asserted, using the same results, that lead was actually nontoxic and a
naturally recurring element. It just goes to show how heavily scientific opinion is at time motivated by 
self-benefit rather than for the sake of social benefit. A take away that I gathered after I watched this 
episode is that a clean working environment is often condusive to great discoveries both on the scale of 
scientific and personal matters.

Episode 10 - "The Electric Boy"

<replace this tag with your response, as brief or lengthy as you like>
This episode is perhaps my favorite because it covers the topic of electromagneticism and tha remains my
favorite subject in physics. I really like the fact that this episode choose not to focus on other more
famous scientists like Newton, Einstein, and Edison that we know too much about and instead revealed the
life of a scientist who is relatively unknown in the modern world despite his groundbreaking inventions.
I was particularly inspired by the fact that Faraday started out in poverty but worked his way up to an
imporant post in the Royal Society by means of his scientific merits in a very class conscious society. 
It was also mentioned in this episode that although Faraday was plagued with memory loss and depression 
later on in his life, he was still able to make a lot of very significant discoveries. It is very hard to 
imagine a world without the application of electricity and it is definitely a knowledge that we take for
granted today in our modern world. While I believe that Faraday was naturally brilliant, the episode also
very importantly emphasized the value of a good education because Faraday, without it, hit a brick wall
when he was asked to derive equations associated with his concepts of electromagneticism. Overall the 
journey that this series had been taking me through with Neil Degrasse Tyson is breathtaking and a very
inspirational experience that definitely had changed my perspective on space time and on the contributions
and lives of famous scientists. In regards to the future, the remaining episodes of this series is definitely
something that I can see myself watching in my spare time. Series that are produced that can match the degree
of quality to the COSMOS series is indeed rare and is absolutely a good way to enlighten myself during my 
week of relaxation.
