Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
Watching this first episode of the COSMOS series really changed my perception of space and
it made me feel insignificant when I compare myself to the vast expanse of space and time.
I think Neil Degrasse Tyson did a really good job as the host of this series because he presented
information very clearly and logically. I also really like the fact that this series covered the
lives in addition to the works done by these scientists as these things generally get overlooked
in all the other science documentaries I had watched. To me the lives of these scientists bring as
much fascination as the work they have done because from the perspective of their life you can see
much of their motivations for discovery. The graphics in this series is AMAZING to say the least and
I have never in my life seen so much attention to detail in the animations portraying the celestial
bodies. One critique that I have of this series, however, is that although the information presented
in the series is articulate, I did not feel like it presented any novel ideas that would lead me to an
epiphany about space. 10/10 on the detail in graphics, but I feel like it is severely lacking detail in
facts and I was presented with a very generic picture of space time. This is the first episode of this
series so I am hopeful that it is only an introduction to the more detailed episodes I will watch later on.

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"

This episode was really amazing and it definitely contained the details I was looking for after I watched the
first episode. I especially liked the scientists in this episode and how they were portrayed by the animation
and commentary by Neil Degrasse Tyson. I found the collaboration between Halley and Newton to be as captivating
as the rivalry between Hooke and Newton. Although this episode did portray the serious degree of animosity that
had exisited between Newton and Hooke, I believed that it did dump a lot more dirt on Hooke than it did on
Newton. Despite the fact that no portrait of Hooke existed, the animation choose to portray Hooke as a mean
spirited old man while Newton was shown to be a rather charming individual. I also liked the fact that despite
the main focus of this series is on astronomy, it found time to explore the other contributions these scientists
made to society. The episode mentioned, for example, that Halley perfected the diving bell, laided the foundation
for population statistics, and introduced symbols that were still used on weather maps. For Newton, they had
mentioned that he had experimented with Alchemy and was a fanatic that tried to find hidden meaning in biblical
text. I had not known these facts prior to watching this episode and it really did come as a surprise to me
that Newton had experimented with what is now regarded as a psuedoscience. The movie also did very briefly
mention that Newton was reponsible for the invention of calculus and I am very disappointed that they did not 
emphasize this achievement to as large of an extent as his discoveries with light for example. This episode 
reaffirmed my generic understanding of comets and the cosmos at large but I was introduced to a variety of 
detailed information that I had not known prior to watching this episode.
