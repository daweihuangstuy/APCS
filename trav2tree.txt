1) Algorithm (given preorder and inorder)
	1) The first preorder node must be the root of the tree
	2) The second preorder node must be the left child of the root node
	3) Follow the preorder node order and create consecutive left children until after
	you have placed the first node of the inorder sequence.
	4) Go up the node you have just formed and place nodes according to its leftmost place
	consistent with its inorder sequence.

2) Algorithm (given inorder and postorder)
	1) Designate the last postorder node as the root of your tree
	2) The left children of the root are all the nodes to the left of the root in the inorder
	sequence and every right children of the root are all to nodes to the right of the inorder
	sequence.
	3) Create the subtree of everything to the right of the root and everything
	to the left of the root. The root of either subtree is the left or right child of the main tree.
	4) Repeat step three until no more subtrees can be created.
	
3) Algorithm (given preorder and postorder)
	- Since preorder and postorder are very similar, they probably would only work if the tree is full.
	1) Designate the first preorder/last post node as the root of the tree.
	2) From the postorder sequence, if the next node matches with the penultimate node of the preorder sequence
	than that is the left child of the root node. ????????????????????????
	3) Repeat step 2 until the tree is comleted. ????????????????????????
